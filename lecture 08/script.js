// LECTURE: Equality Operators: == vs. ===
// 1. Declare a variable 'numNeighbours' based on a prompt input like this:
// prompt('How many neighbour countries does your country
// have?');
// 2. If there is only 1 neighbour, log to the console 'Only 1 border!' (use loose equality
// == for now)
// 3. Use an else-if block to log 'More than 1 border' in case 'numNeighbours'
// is greater than 1
// 4. Use an else block to log 'No borders' (this block will be executed when
// 'numNeighbours' is 0 or any other value)
// 5. Test the code with different values of 'numNeighbours', including 1 and 0.
// 6. Change == to ===, and test the code again, with the same values of
// 'numNeighbours'. Notice what happens when there is exactly 1 border! Why
// is this happening?
// 7. Finally, convert 'numNeighbours' to a number, and watch what happens now
// when you input 1
// 8. Reflect on why we should use the === operator and type conversion in this
// situation

// Loose Equality Operator(==) and Strict Equlaity Operator(===)
// const numNeighbours = Number(
//   prompt("How many neighbour countries does your country have?")
// );

const numNeighbours = 1;
if (numNeighbours === 1) {
  // '1' === 1
  console.log("Only One Border");
} else if (numNeighbours > 1) {
  console.log("More Than One");
} else {
  console.log("No Border");
}

// LECTURE: Logical Operators
// 1. Comment out the previous code so the prompt doesn't get in the way
// 2. Let's say Sarah is looking for a new country to live in. She wants to live in a
// country that speaks english, has less than 50 million people and is not an
// island.
// 3. Write an if statement to help Sarah figure out if your country is right for her.
// You will need to write a condition that accounts for all of Sarah's criteria. Take
// your time with this, and check part of the solution if necessary.
// 4. If yours is the right country, log a string like this: 'You should live in Portugal :)'. If
// not, log 'Portugal does not meet your criteria :('
// 5. Probably your country does not meet all the criteria. So go back and temporarily
// change some variables in order to make the condition true (unless you live in
// Canada :D)
let country = "Canada";
let population = "30";
let language = "English";
let isIsland = false;
if (language == "English" && population < 50 && !isIsland) {
  console.log(`You should live in ${country}`);
} else {
  console.log(`${country} does not meet Your Criteria`);
}

// LECTURE:  The switch Statement
// Use a switch statement to log the following string for the given 'language':
// chinese or mandarin: 'MOST number of native speakers!'
// spanish: '2nd place in number of native speakers'
// english: '3rd place'
// hindi: 'Number 4'
// arabic: '5th most spoken language'
// for all other simply log 'Great language too :D'
